1. Identify the entities that communicate with one another using this protocol.
   In most cases there are two entities with one acting as the client and the
   other as the server, or caller and callee. But in some protocols there may be
   three kinds of entities with a third entity acting as a manager, facilitator,
   or go-between.

2. Describe how devices identify themselves on the network, and become known to
   other devices on the network. If initial connection involves a handshake,
   describe the handshake. If identities are given, describe how the identities
   are assured to be unique.

3. Discuss the issue of traffic and congestion., Describe how the network and
   protocol addresses the problem of either too many devices trying to use the
   network at the same time or trying to push too much data through the network.
   Do devices take turns (how do they know?). Do devices tell get told to stop
   or wait? Do devices get told to slow down or speed up? How are control
   signals separated from data?

4. Discuss the issues of security.  
   
   a. Does the protocol address the issue of
   privacy? If so, how? If not, what risks might exist?  
   
   b. Does the protocol
   protect against malicious interlopers on the network? If so how? If not, how
   might the network be exploited or compromised by someone who could connect a
   malicious device to the network?  
   
   c. How does the protocol recover after a
   failure, i.e. after a power outage or some other breakdown?

5. Is efficiency a concern? Does the protocol have features to optimize data
   transmission rates? What does it do to control or adjust speeds? What if
   different devices have different speed capabilities?

6. How does the protocol address communication failures? What kinds of failures
   are addressed? Suggest two kinds of failures that are not addressed, and
   discuss what could happen to senders and receivers in a failure of that kind.
